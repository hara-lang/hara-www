title: "Part I — Draw the board"
---
Before there is a game, there is a canvas and a few drawing commands. Start by
loading `studio.draw`: it is the small host-facing library that waits for a
canvas frame and submits a list of drawing commands to it.

The program below follows the complete first drawing path:

1. `node/start` keeps one live drawing process running.
2. `draw/next-frame` gives that process its canvas turn.
3. `draw/render` sends `opening-commands` to the named canvas.

A canvas command is just data: `[:line x1 y1 x2 y2 color width alpha]`. Read
the first vector as: draw a vertical line from `(220, 170)` to `(220, 470)`,
muted blue, two pixels wide, fully opaque.

`draw/render` is the only point at which those values become pixels. There is
no board widget hiding behind this example: the four `:line` vectors below are
the board.

## Practicals — draw with commands

`studio.draw` is the Hara API for a kernel to communicate with the browser's
Canvas 2D API. It does not contain Tic Tac Toe rules. Instead, the kernel asks
for a frame with `draw/next-frame`, then uses `draw/render` to send explicit
command data through the declared canvas capability.

Run this first program. It imports `studio.draw`, starts one live kernel node,
and draws the four lines that make the board. Then change one command and run
it again.

```clojure
(ns+
  (:require [studio.draw :as draw]))

;; A value describing pixels—not pixels yet.
(defn opening-commands [width height]
  [[:grid 48 "rgba(67,247,231,.12)" 1]
   [:line 220 170 220 470 "#386779" 2 1]

   [:line 60 370 540 370 "#386779" 2 1]])

;; This is where the command data becomes a visible board.
(node/start
  (fn []
    (loop []
      (let [frame (co/await (draw/next-frame "canvas/background"))]
        (co/await (draw/render "canvas/background"
          {:type :canvas-2d
           :background "#03070d"
           :commands (opening-commands 960 600)}))
        (recur)))))

<div class="hara-board-annotations">
  <section><b>MOVE A LINE</b><p>Change both <code>220</code> values in the first line to <code>250</code>. Run the file. The shared <code>x</code> keeps it vertical.</p></section>
  <section><b>CHANGE A COLOUR</b><p>Replace <code>"#386779"</code> with <code>"#ff78b3"</code>, then run again. The command is the whole instruction.</p></section>
  <section><b>ADD A LINE</b><p>Copy one <code>:line</code> vector. Give its endpoints a shared <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> and observe the result.</p></section>
  <section><b>DRAW A CIRCLE</b><p>Add <code>[:circle 300 320 24 "#7dfff3" 1]</code>. This is the same command-list idea, with a different primitive.</p></section>

<div class="hara-canvas-command-cards">
  <section><b>:line</b><code>[:line x1 y1 x2 y2 color width alpha]</code><p>Draw a straight segment. Four lines make the board grid.</p></section>
  <section><b>:circle</b><code>[:circle x y radius color alpha]</code><p>Draw a filled circle. Later, two circles make an O.</p></section>
  <section><b>:rect</b><code>[:rect x y width height color alpha]</code><p>Fill a rectangle for a panel, button, or board background.</p></section>
  <section><b>:text</b><code>[:text label x y color size]</code><p>Put a status label or instruction onto the canvas.</p></section>
  <section><b>:grid</b><code>[:grid spacing color width]</code><p>Draw a regular guide grid behind the game.</p></section>
  <section><b>:mist</b><code>[:mist x y radius color alpha]</code><p>Add a soft radial glow behind a piece or winning line.</p></section>
