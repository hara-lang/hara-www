title: "01. Basic data and immutable collections"
---
Hara programs start with values. Most values are immutable. An operation returns a new value instead of changing the old value.

This lesson introduces scalar values, collection literals, lookup, and persistent updates.

The runnable examples on this page share one lesson session. Work from top to
bottom when an example uses an earlier definition, and reload the page to start
with a clean session.

## Learning goals

By the end of this lesson, you can:

1. Read the main Hara literal forms.
2. Distinguish a list form from a vector value.
3. Use keywords to label data.
4. Read values from vectors and maps.
5. Update a persistent collection without mutation.
6. Choose a collection from the job it performs.

## Scalar values

A scalar value is one value that is not a collection.

### Nil and booleans

Hara has one empty value and two boolean values:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
nil
true
false
```

Only `nil` and `false` are falsey. Zero, an empty string, and an empty collection are truthy.

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(if 0 :yes :no)
; => :yes

(if [] :yes :no)
; => :yes
```

Do not use emptiness as a boolean test. Use an explicit predicate such as `empty?`.

### Numbers

Hara supports integers and floating-point values:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
42
-7
3.5
```

It also reads big integers and big decimals:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
12345678901234567890N
19.95M
```

The suffix is part of the numeric literal.

Ratios are not an L0 numeric type. Division does not create a ratio value.

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(/ 5 2)
```

Check the result in your current runtime before you build numeric rules around integer division.

### Strings and characters

A string contains text:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
"HAL"
"line one\nline two"
```

A character is a single character value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
\a
\newline
```

Strings are immutable. String transformation functions return new strings.

### Keywords

A keyword is a stable label:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
:name
:task/title
:status/ready
```

Keywords often label fields in maps. A namespaced keyword makes the domain explicit.

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
{:task/title "Read input"
 :task/status :status/ready}
```

### Symbols

A symbol names a Var, local binding, function, namespace, or other program entity:

```clojure
score
map
file/read
```

The evaluator resolves an unquoted symbol. Quote returns the symbol itself:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
'file/read
; => file/read
```

A keyword usually labels data. A symbol usually names program behavior or a binding.

## Collection literals

Hara has lists, vectors, maps, and sets.

### Lists

A list uses parentheses:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(+ 19 23)
```

In source code, the evaluator normally treats a list as a call or special form.

Quote a list when you want list data:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
'(north east south west)
```

Use lists for forms and list-shaped data. Do not use a list only because HAL
uses parentheses for evaluation forms.

### Vectors

A vector uses square brackets:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
["alpha" "beta" "gamma"]
```

A vector preserves order and supports indexed access:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(nth [10 20 30] 1)
; => 20
```

Indexes start at zero.

Use a vector for ordered records, argument lists, coordinates, and finite sequences that need indexed access.

### Maps

A map associates keys with values:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
{:task/id 1
 :task/title "Read input"
 :task/done false}
```

Use `get` to read a key:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(get {:task/title "Read input"} :task/title)
; => "Read input"
```

A keyword can also look itself up in a map:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(:task/title {:task/title "Read input"})
; => "Read input"
```

Use a map when fields have names.

### Sets

A set contains unique values:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
#{:read :transform :write}
```

Adding an existing value does not create a duplicate:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(conj #{:read :write} :read)
; => #{:read :write}
```

Use a set for membership, permissions, tags, and unique categories.

## Persistent updates

A persistent collection does not change in place. An update returns another collection.

### Add a vector item

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(def steps [:read :transform])
(def next-steps (conj steps :write))

steps
; => [:read :transform]

next-steps
; => [:read :transform :write]
```

The old vector remains valid.

### Replace a map field

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(def task
  {:task/id 1
   :task/title "Read input"
   :task/done false})

(def completed-task
  (assoc task :task/done true))
```

`assoc` returns a map with the selected key associated with the new value.

### Remove a map field

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(dissoc task :task/title)
; => {:task/id 1 :task/done false}
```

The original `task` value still contains the title.

### Update nested data

Use `get-in` and `assoc-in` for nested paths:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(def job
  {:job/id 7
   :job/progress {:current 0 :total 3}})

(get-in job [:job/progress :total])
; => 3

(assoc-in job [:job/progress :current] 1)
```

Use `update-in` when the new value depends on the old value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(update-in job [:job/progress :current] inc)
```

Each operation returns a new root map.

## Collection operations preserve the boundary

Persistent operations return persistent values:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(conj [1 2] 3)
(assoc {:a 1} :b 2)
(dissoc {:a 1 :b 2} :a)
```

These operations do not silently create mutable arrays or objects.

Later, you will use `array` and `object` when mutation is intentional.

## Build the course configuration

Create one immutable configuration value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(def config
  {:input/path "data/input.txt"
   :output/path "data/output.txt"
   :pipeline/steps [:trim :remove-empty :number]
   :pipeline/tags #{:text :utf8}
   :pipeline/options
   {:skip-empty true
    :max-lines 1000}})
```

Read one value from each collection level:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(:input/path config)

(nth (:pipeline/steps config) 1)

(get-in config [:pipeline/options :max-lines])
```

Create a changed configuration without changing `config`:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(def small-config
  (assoc-in config [:pipeline/options :max-lines] 10))
```

## Practice loop

Use this sequence for each form:

1. Predict the result.
2. Run the form.
3. Change one literal.
4. Explain which value changed.

Try these changes:

1. Add another pipeline step.
2. Add a tag to the set.
3. Change the maximum line count.
4. Remove the output path.
5. Confirm that the original value remains unchanged.

## Common mistakes

### Treating parentheses as a container

```clojure
(1 2 3)
```

The evaluator tries to call `1`. Quote list data or use a vector.

### Expecting `assoc` to mutate

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(assoc config :input/path "other.txt")
config
```

The second form returns the original value because the first result was not stored or passed onward.

### Using truthiness for emptiness

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-01
(if [] :empty :not-empty)
; => :empty
```

This label is misleading. Empty collections are truthy. Use `empty?`.

### Mixing field names

Do not call the same field `:path`, `:file`, and `:input` in nearby examples. Choose one stable key such as `:input/path`.

## Check yourself

You are ready for the next lesson when you can answer these questions:

1. Which Hara values are falsey?
2. Why does a list often represent code?
3. When should you use a vector instead of a map?
4. What does `assoc` return?
5. Why can old and new persistent values coexist?
6. When is a set a better fit than a vector?
7. What is the difference between a keyword and a symbol?
