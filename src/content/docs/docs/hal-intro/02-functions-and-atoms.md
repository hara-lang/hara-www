title: "02. Functions and atoms"
---
A function transforms input values into a result. An atom stores one value that a running program can replace.

Keep these jobs separate:

- A function describes a change.
- An atom records the current value.

The runnable examples on this page share one lesson session. Work from top to
bottom when an example uses an earlier definition, and reload the page to start
with a clean session.

## Learning goals

By the end of this lesson, you can:

1. Create anonymous and named functions.
2. Read parameter vectors and return values.
3. Use local bindings.
4. Build pure state-transition functions.
5. Create and read an atom.
6. Replace atom state with `reset!` and `swap!`.
7. Keep effects outside state-transition functions.

## Anonymous functions

Use `fn` to create a function value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(fn [line] (str/trim line))
```

The parameter vector names the inputs. The body returns its final value.

Call the function directly:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
((fn [number] (+ number 1)) 41)
; => 42
```

The inner form creates the function. The outer form calls it.

## Named functions

Use `defn` to define a function in the current namespace:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn clean-line [line]
  (str/trim line))

(clean-line "  Hara  ")
; => "Hara"
```

Read the definition in four parts:

1. `defn` defines a function.
2. `clean-line` is the function name.
3. `[line]` is the parameter vector.
4. `(str/trim line)` is the body.

A good function name states what the returned value means.

## Functions return values

A function returns the value of its final body form:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn line-info [line]
  (str/trim line)
  {:line/text line
   :line/length (count line)})
```

The map is the result. The earlier trim result is discarded.

Do not place forms in a function body unless their results or effects matter.

## Local bindings

Use `let` to name intermediate values:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn line-record [line-number line]
  (let [cleaned (str/trim line)]
    {:line/number line-number
     :line/text cleaned
     :line/empty (empty? cleaned)}))
```

The local name `cleaned` exists only inside the `let` body.

### Dependent local values

Hara evaluates sibling `let` initializers against the enclosing lexical environment. One sibling initializer cannot depend on a new sibling binding.

Use a nested `let` when the second value needs the first:

```clojure
(let [cleaned (str/trim line)]
  (let [length (count cleaned)]
    {:line/text cleaned
     :line/length length}))
```

This rule makes the dependency visible.

## Pure state transitions

A state-transition function receives an old state and returns a new state.

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn mark-started [state]
  (assoc state :run/status :status/running))
```

The function does not know where the state is stored.

Add progress with another pure function:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn record-line [state]
  (update state :run/line-count inc))
```

Create the initial state:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(def initial-state
  {:run/status :status/idle
   :run/line-count 0
   :run/error nil})
```

Test a transition with plain data:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(record-line initial-state)
; => {:run/status :status/idle
;     :run/line-count 1
;     :run/error nil}
```

The original state remains unchanged.

## Create an atom

Use an atom when the program needs one replaceable current value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(def run-state
  (atom initial-state))
```

The atom is not the state map. The atom contains the current state map.

Read the atom with `deref`:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(deref run-state)
```

The reader shorthand is `@`:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
@run-state
```

Both forms return the current value.

## Replace atom state

Use `reset!` when you already have the complete next value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(reset! run-state initial-state)
```

`reset!` returns the value that it stores.

Use `swap!` when the next value depends on the current value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(swap! run-state mark-started)
```

`swap!` reads the current value, calls the function, and stores the returned value.

Pass additional function arguments after the function:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn record-error [state message]
  (assoc state
         :run/status :status/failed
         :run/error message))

(swap! run-state record-error "Input file is missing")
```

The function receives the current state first, then the extra arguments.

## Keep the transition reusable

This is easy to test:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(record-error initial-state "bad input")
```

This version hides storage inside the transformation:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn fail-run! [message]
  (swap! run-state record-error message))
```

The second function can be useful at an application boundary. The first function remains the reusable domain rule.

Use `!` at the end of a name when the operation changes state or performs an effect.

## Compare and set

Use `compare-and-set!` when the replacement must happen only if the atom still contains an expected value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(compare-and-set!
  run-state
  initial-state
  (mark-started initial-state))
```

The operation returns a boolean result.

This operation is identity-sensitive for the expected atom value. Prefer `swap!` for normal state transitions.

## One atom can hold a complete model

A common design stores one coherent immutable model in one atom:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(def app-state
  (atom
    {:run/status :status/idle
     :run/line-count 0
     :run/current nil
     :run/messages []}))
```

A transition can update several related fields together:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(defn begin-line [state line-number]
  (assoc state
         :run/status :status/running
         :run/current line-number))

(swap! app-state begin-line 1)
```

This is easier to reason about than several atoms that can drift into inconsistent combinations.

## Atom state is still immutable data

The atom changes which value it contains. It does not make the contained map mutable.

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(def before @app-state)
(swap! app-state record-line)
(def after @app-state)
```

`before` and `after` are separate persistent values.

This property makes history, comparison, rollback, and UI rendering easier.

## Build the course state model

Add these definitions to your course project:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(def initial-run
  {:run/status :status/idle
   :run/line-count 0
   :run/byte-count 0
   :run/current nil
   :run/error nil})

(def run
  (atom initial-run))

(defn start-run [state]
  (assoc state :run/status :status/running))

(defn add-line [state byte-count]
  (-> state
      (update :run/line-count inc)
      (update :run/byte-count + byte-count)))

(defn finish-run [state]
  (assoc state
         :run/status :status/complete
         :run/current nil))
```

Hara supports the threading macro used above. Read it as a sequence of updates to the state value.

Exercise the state:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(reset! run initial-run)
(swap! run start-run)
(swap! run add-line 12)
(swap! run add-line 8)
(swap! run finish-run)
@run
```

## Practice loop

For each transition:

1. Predict the returned state.
2. Call the function with plain data.
3. Call the same function through `swap!`.
4. Compare the plain result with the atom value.
5. Change one argument and explain the new state.

## Common mistakes

### Putting an atom inside every function

A function that accepts plain state is easier to test, reuse, and trace.

### Forgetting to dereference

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
run
```

This returns the atom object. Use `@run` for its current value.

### Ignoring the return value of a persistent update

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-02
(assoc @run :run/status :status/complete)
@run
```

The atom did not change. Use `swap!` or `reset!` to store a replacement.

### Mixing transformation and I/O

Do not make `record-line` also write a file. Let the function calculate state. Let an I/O boundary write bytes.

## Check yourself

You are ready for the next lesson when you can answer these questions:

1. What value does a function return?
2. Why should a transition accept plain state?
3. What does an atom contain?
4. What is the difference between `reset!` and `swap!`?
5. Why can old atom values remain useful?
6. When should a function name end in `!`?
7. Why might one atom be safer than several related atoms?
