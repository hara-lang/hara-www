title: "06. Bytes and strings"
---
A string represents text. Bytes represent binary storage.

Text must be encoded before a byte-oriented API can write or send it. Bytes must be decoded before text functions can interpret them.

Hara uses UTF-8 for string encoding and decoding.

The runnable examples on this page share one lesson session. Work from top to
bottom when an example uses an earlier definition, and reload the page to start
with a clean session.

## Learning goals

By the end of this lesson, you can:

1. Build and transform strings.
2. Join, trim, and normalize text.
3. Encode a string as UTF-8 bytes.
4. Decode UTF-8 bytes as a string.
5. Read signed and unsigned byte views.
6. Update, copy, and slice byte buffers.
7. Keep text and binary boundaries explicit.

## Strings are immutable text

Create a string literal:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
"HAL"
```

Combine values with `str`:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(str "line=" 42)
; => "line=42"
```

`str` converts its arguments to text and concatenates them.

The result is a new string. Existing strings do not change.

## Trim text

Use `str/trim` to remove leading and trailing whitespace:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(str/trim "  HAL  ")
; => "HAL"
```

Store the result when later code needs the cleaned value:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def raw-line "  Alpha  ")
(def clean-line (str/trim raw-line))
```

`raw-line` still contains its original spaces.

## Normalize case

Convert text to lower case:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(str/lower "HARA")
; => "hara"
```

Use one normalization rule before comparison:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(defn normalized-name [value]
  (str/lower (str/trim value)))

(= (normalized-name " Hara ")
   (normalized-name "HARA"))
; => true
```

Case normalization is not a complete Unicode identity or locale policy. Use it only when the application contract calls for this comparison.

## Join string values

Use `str/join` to place a separator between values:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(str/join "," ["alpha" "beta" "gamma"])
; => "alpha,beta,gamma"
```

Build an output line from stable fields:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(defn record-line [record]
  (str/join "\t"
    [(:line/number record)
     (:line/text record)]))
```

Use an explicit separator. Do not rely on printed collection syntax as a file format.

## Newlines are data

A newline inside a string is represented with an escape:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
"first\nsecond"
```

Append one line terminator at the output boundary:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(defn terminated-line [line]
  (str line "\n"))
```

Keep the internal line value and the serialized line representation distinct.

## Encode text as bytes

Use `str/encode-utf8` to encode a string as UTF-8:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def encoded
  (str/encode-utf8 "Hara"))
```

The result is a bytes value.

Count its byte length:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(bytes/count encoded)
; => 4
```

Character count and byte count can differ:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def word "café")

(count word)
(bytes/count (str/encode-utf8 word))
```

UTF-8 uses more than one byte for many non-ASCII characters.

Use byte count for file sizes, protocol lengths, and storage limits. Use text length only when the application contract defines what a text unit means.

## Decode bytes as text

Use `str/decode-utf8` to decode UTF-8 bytes:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(str/decode-utf8 encoded)
; => "Hara"
```

Round-trip text through UTF-8:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def original "HAL")
(def round-trip
  (str/decode-utf8 (str/encode-utf8 original)))

(= original round-trip)
; => true
```

Decoding requires valid input under the string library contract. Do not assume arbitrary binary data is text.

## Create bytes directly

Use `bytes` to create mutable binary storage:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def packet
  (bytes 72 97 114 97))
```

Input values accept the checked range from `-128` through `255`.

Readable bytes print with the bytes constructor form:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(bytes 1 2 -3)
```

## Read unsigned byte values

`bytes/get` returns an unsigned value from `0` through `255`:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(bytes/get packet 0)
; => 72
```

It can accept a fallback for an invalid index:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(bytes/get packet 100 nil)
; => nil
```

Without a fallback, an invalid index reports a bounds error.

## Signed protocol view

The ordinary indexed protocol preserves signed byte storage:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def signed-sample
  (bytes -1 0 1))

(nth signed-sample 0)
; => -1

(bytes/get signed-sample 0)
; => 255
```

The stored bits are the same. The operation chooses the signed or unsigned view.

Use `bytes/u8` and `bytes/s8` when code must state the conversion explicitly.

## Update bytes

Bytes are mutable:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def mutable-packet
  (bytes 1 2 3))

(bytes/set mutable-packet 1 42)
(bytes/get mutable-packet 1)
; => 42
```

`bytes/set` mutates and returns the same byte-buffer identity.

Do not treat bytes like a persistent vector.

## Copy bytes

Create independent storage with `bytes/copy`:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def packet-copy
  (bytes/copy mutable-packet))
```

Update the copy:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(bytes/set packet-copy 0 99)
```

The original buffer retains its original first byte.

Copy when another component needs ownership of an independent mutable buffer.

## Slice bytes

Create a selected byte range:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(def header
  (bytes/slice mutable-packet 0 2))
```

The slice allocates independent storage.

Use a slice for a protocol field, file segment, prefix, or bounded decoder input.

## Bytes use content equality

Bytes have mutable identity, but their equality and hashing contract uses byte content.

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(= (bytes 1 2 3)
   (bytes 1 2 3))
; => true
```

Be careful when a mutable bytes value is used where stable hashing matters. A later mutation can change its content.

Copy or freeze the data into a stable representation before long-lived keyed use.

## Text pipeline boundary

A common file pipeline has four stages:

```text
file bytes
-> UTF-8 decode
-> string transformations
-> UTF-8 encode
-> output bytes
```

Represent each conversion explicitly:

```clojure eval group=hal-intro-06
(defn transform-text-bytes [input-bytes]
  (-> input-bytes
      (str/decode-utf8)
      (str/trim)
      (str/lower)
      (str "\n")
      (str/encode-utf8)))
```

The returned value is bytes, ready for a byte-oriented file or socket API.

## Build the course encoder

Create a serialized line:

```clojure
(defn encode-output-line [line-number line]
  (str/encode-utf8
    (str/join "\t"
      [line-number
       (normalize-line line)
       "\n"])))
```

Inspect the result:

```clojure
(def output-bytes
  (encode-output-line 1 " Alpha "))

(bytes/count output-bytes)
(str/decode-utf8 output-bytes)
```

Record the actual byte count in the run state:

```clojure
(swap! run add-line (bytes/count output-bytes))
```

The state now records transport size rather than an assumed character count.

## Practice loop

1. Predict a string result.
2. Encode it.
3. Inspect each byte with `bytes/get`.
4. Decode it.
5. Change one non-ASCII character.
6. Compare character count and byte count.
7. Copy the bytes and mutate only the copy.

## Common mistakes

### Passing a string to a byte API

Encode the string first.

### Decoding arbitrary binary data

Only decode bytes that the surrounding contract identifies as text.

### Assuming character count equals byte count

Use `bytes/count` after encoding.

### Forgetting byte mutation

Copy a byte buffer when independent ownership matters.

### Mixing signed and unsigned views

Use `bytes/get` for unsigned values and explicit conversion functions when the representation matters.

## Check yourself

You are ready for the next lesson when you can answer these questions:

1. Why are strings and bytes separate value categories?
2. Which encoding does Hara use for string conversion?
3. Why can text length and byte length differ?
4. What range does `bytes/get` return?
5. How does `nth` expose a stored negative byte?
6. Why should a byte buffer be copied?
7. What value type should a file write operation receive?
