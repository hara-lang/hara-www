title: First Contact
---
This is a short working session, not a survey of the whole language. On the
main Hara site, the six examples share one named lesson session, so definitions
remain available as you move down the page. Each step is also self-contained
and can be rerun safely.

Use the same rhythm throughout:

1. Predict the result.
2. Run the form.
3. Change one value.
4. Explain the new result in one sentence.

<div class="hara-syllabus" data-hara-syllabus="first-contact-v1" data-hara-syllabus-title="First Contact" data-hara-session-group="first-contact">

<div class="hara-syllabus-step" data-hara-step="01-run-one-form">

## 01 — Run one form

Most Hara expressions use one visible shape: the operation comes first, followed
by its inputs.

```clojure eval group=first-contact
(+ 19 23)
```

Change either number and run it again. Nothing else is required to begin.

**What to notice:** the source form and the returned value stay close together.

</div>

<div class="hara-syllabus-step" data-hara-step="02-shape-data">

## 02 — Give information a shape

Vectors keep order. Maps give facts names. Keywords make those names stable and
readable.

```clojure eval group=first-contact
(let [player {:name "Nova"
              :score 10
              :items ["lamp" "cable"]}]
  {:name (:name player)
   :first-item (nth (:items player) 0)})
```

Replace the name, add another item, or retrieve a different field.

**What to notice:** the same value can be read directly, inspected, tested, or
passed to another function.

</div>

<div class="hara-syllabus-step" data-hara-step="03-name-a-transformation">

## 03 — Name a transformation

A function receives values and returns a value. It does not need to know where
those values came from or where the result will go.

```clojure eval group=first-contact
(do
  (defn add-score [player amount]
    (update player :score + amount))

  (add-score {:name "Nova" :score 10} 25))
```

Change the amount, then add another field to the player map. The function still
has one clear job.

**What to notice:** a useful name turns a general operation into a domain rule.

</div>

<div class="hara-syllabus-step" data-hara-step="04-keep-the-original">

## 04 — Keep the original

Persistent data lets an old value and a changed value coexist.

```clojure eval group=first-contact
(let [original {:name "Nova" :score 10}
      changed (assoc original :score 35)]
  {:original original
   :changed changed})
```

Change another field and inspect both maps again.

**What to notice:** history, comparison, testing, rollback, and explanation all
become easier when updates return values rather than silently rewriting them.

</div>

<div class="hara-syllabus-step" data-hara-step="05-one-operation-many-values">

## 05 — One operation, many values

`count` works with several kinds of value because those values participate in a
shared contract.

```clojure eval group=first-contact
{:vector (count [10 20 30])
 :map (count {:left 10 :right 20})
 :set (count #{:read :build :test})}
```

The call does not need a different spelling for every collection type.

**What to notice:** the important idea is not the concrete type. It is the
ability the value provides.

</div>

<div class="hara-syllabus-step" data-hara-step="06-let-a-new-value-join">

## 06 — Let a new value join the language

`ICount` is Hara's countability protocol. Its canonical identity lives at
`std.protocol.icount/ICount`. A new value can implement that contract and work
with the ordinary `count` function.

```clojure eval group=first-contact
(do
  (defstruct Inventory [items])

  (extend-type Inventory ICount
    (count [inventory]
      (count (field inventory :items))))

  (count (Inventory ["lamp" "cable" "radio"])))
```

Add or remove an item. Then rename `Inventory`; the calling convention does not
change.

**What to notice:** existing code gains a new implementation without being
rewritten.

</div>

</div>

## What you have learned

You have already used Hara's central progression:

```text
value → transformation → persistent result → shared protocol
```

Hara is not simple because it can do less. It stays simple because a small
vocabulary can be extended.
